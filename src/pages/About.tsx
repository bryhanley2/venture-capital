  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">The Results</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Every evaluation strengthens the model. As outcomes emerge and patterns crystallize, the framework becomes increasingly precise at separating meaningful signals from market noise—creating a compounding advantage over time.
  </p>
  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    By analyzing patterns across successful and failed companies, the framework reveals which factors consistently predict unicorn outcomes before they become more obvious to typical investors. Understanding what drove Stripe, Airbnb, and Coinbase from seed to $10B+ enables earlier identification of tomorrow's breakthrough companies.  </p>
