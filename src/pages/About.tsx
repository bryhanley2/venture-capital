          By analyzing patterns across successful and failed startups at their earli stages, the framework reveals which factors consistently predict unicorn outcomes. Understanding what drove Stripe, Airbnb, and Coinbase from seed to $10B+ enables earlier identification of tomorrow's breakthrough companies—before they become more obvious to traditional investors.
