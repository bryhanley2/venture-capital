        This platform applies data-driven rigor to seed-stage investing, validated by correctly identifying 
        all 15 unicorns and all 8 failures in a 50-company historical analysis. The framework reveals 
        the 11 factors that separate billion-dollar outcomes from inevitable shutdowns.

          Every evaluation strengthens the model. As outcomes emerge and patterns crystallize, 
          the framework becomes increasingly precise at separating meaningful signals from market noise—creating 
          a compounding advantage over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          By analyzing patterns across successful and failed companies, the framework reveals which factors 
          consistently predict unicorn outcomes before they become more obvious to typical investors. 
          Understanding what drove Stripe, Airbnb, and Coinbase from seed to $10B+ enables earlier 
          identification of tomorrow's breakthrough companies.
